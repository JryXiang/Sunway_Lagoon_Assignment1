        <p style="font-size: 15pt; text-align: justify;"><br>Lost World Of Tambun is an action packed, wholesome family adventure destination. This self-contained wonderland is cocooned by lush tropical jungle, natural hot springs, breathtaking limestone features of 400 million years of age and seven amazing attraction parks making it the ultimate day and night destination for a unique eco-adventure excursion for visitors of all ages. Just a stone’s throw away is the Lost World Hotel, a perfect snooze chamber after a long day of adventure.<br><br>Lost World Of Tambun offers not only a “lost paradise” that promises fun and wholesome experience for all ages but also a conducive learning environment with a range of fun educational elements around the park. We are also the only theme park in Southeast Asia with natural hot springs coupled with an array of attractions and rides.<br><br>Business entities and MICE groups can conduct their team building activities or meetings at any of the Hotel’s seven function rooms and at the park’s themed locations (including Kepura Cave) which offer a capacity ranging from 10 to 200 people.<br><br>We take pride in being able to restore the glory of a tin-mining wasteland to an iconic landmark that it is today putting Lost World Of Tambun on Malaysia’s tourist map. This is the reason we are “More Than Just A Theme Park!”<br><br></p>
